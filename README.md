# Library-db
Me and my team made a database using MySQL, hosting a library.  
This library contains a variety of media,
including books, movies and games.  
Books have a title, author, genre
and language.  
Movies have a title, director,
genre, language and age restriction.  
Games have a title, genre and age
restriction.  
The library employs a librarian, who
has a name, id and salary. The librarian can add new media or remove old media from the library.  
The library lets users, defined by a
name, user id and birth date, use
the library.  
The users can make a rent agree-
ment, enabling them to rent media,
which they have to return before a
given return date. If they fail to do
so, they will be given a fine, with a
certain price.
